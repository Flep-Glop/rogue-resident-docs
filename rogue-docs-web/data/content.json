  "core-systems-design.md": "# Core Systems Design Philosophy\n\n**Document Version:** 3.0  \n**Purpose:** Narrative context for core game systems  \n**Technical Reference:** `data/constants/game-constants.yaml`, `data/stars/stars-definitions.yaml`\n\n> This document explains the **why** behind the systems - for the **what** and **how**, see the technical YAML specifications.\n\n## Resource Systems as Professional Development\n\n### Star Points: The Economy of Expertise\n\nThe SP economy (300 available vs 450 needed) deliberately creates scarcity that mirrors real professional development. No one can master everything - professionals must choose where to focus their limited time and energy.\n\n**Design Intent:** Force meaningful specialization choices while ensuring multiple viable paths to competence. The 33% gap means players must thoughtfully decide which expertise areas to prioritize, just like real medical physicists who develop particular strengths.\n\n**Narrative Context:** Star Points represent the finite mental energy and time available for professional development during a residency year. The progression from 75 SP per season reflects increasing capacity as players develop better learning strategies.\n\n### Insight: Daily Engagement and Flow\n\nInsight resets daily and fluctuates based on engagement, representing the natural rhythm of professional energy and attention.\n\n**Design Intent:** Create daily tactical decisions about when and how to apply expertise. High Insight enables powerful applications, but players must manage this resource carefully throughout the day.\n\n**Narrative Context:** Insight captures the mental clarity and engagement that comes from being \"in the zone\" professionally. Some days you're sharp and can tackle complex problems; other days require more basic, foundational work.\n\n### Momentum: The Flow State of Learning\n\nMomentum builds through consecutive success and breaks on failure, representing the psychological state of focused learning.\n\n**Design Intent:** Reward sustained focus and thoughtful problem-solving while creating risk/reward decisions about when to attempt challenging problems.\n\n**Narrative Context:** Momentum represents the flow state that comes from engaging deeply with material. When you're understanding concepts well, each new insight builds on the last. When you hit a wall, you need to step back and rebuild understanding.\n\n## Knowledge Constellation: Expertise as Connection\n\n### Stars as Knowledge Nodes\n\nIndividual stars represent discrete areas of expertise, but the real power comes from understanding how they relate to each other.\n\n**Design Intent:** Reflect the reality that medical physics expertise comes from integration, not memorization. Individual facts matter less than understanding how concepts inform each other.\n\n**Narrative Context:** Each star is a place you can \"stand\" in the knowledge landscape. Mastery means not just knowing each location, but understanding the routes between them and why those paths exist.\n\n### Connections as Understanding\n\nThe connection system requires both stars to be unlocked and minimum mastery levels because genuine understanding of relationships requires solid foundation knowledge.\n\n**Design Intent:** Prevent superficial \"dot-connecting\" without deep understanding. Cross-domain connections are harder than same-domain because they require broader perspective.\n\n**Narrative Context:** Professional expertise isn't just knowing facts in isolation - it's understanding how treatment planning informs radiation therapy, how equipment knowledge enables better dosimetry, how all domains connect to provide better patient care.\n\n### Patterns as Professional Perspective\n\nEtching patterns represent breakthrough moments when disconnected knowledge suddenly coheres into deeper understanding.\n\n**Design Intent:** Provide major progression milestones that feel like genuine insights. These aren't just mechanical bonuses - they represent shifts in professional perspective.\n\n**Narrative Context:** Every professional has moments where multiple concepts suddenly \"click\" together, revealing a deeper pattern. These insights often come through specific learning experiences (etchings) that help you see familiar knowledge in new ways.\n\n## Applications: Knowledge in Practice\n\n### Daily Selection as Professional Identity\n\nChoosing three applications each day represents how professionals decide which aspects of their expertise to emphasize in their daily work.\n\n**Design Intent:** Make knowledge feel practical and immediately relevant. Players aren't just accumulating abstract concepts - they're building a toolkit for professional practice.\n\n**Narrative Context:** Real medical physicists have broad training but develop particular strengths and approaches. Your daily application choices reflect your developing professional identity and preferred problem-solving methods.\n\n### Passive vs Active Effects\n\nThe distinction between passive and active effects mirrors how professional expertise works - some knowledge is always informing your work, while other knowledge you apply deliberately to specific challenges.\n\n**Design Intent:** Create both ambient benefits (passive) and tactical decisions (active). Players feel the benefit of their expertise constantly, but also have moments of purposeful application.\n\n**Narrative Context:** Your radiation therapy knowledge is always informing how you think about cases (passive), but when you need to solve a specific dosimetry problem, you deliberately apply your understanding of measurement principles (active).\n\n## Boss Encounters: Professional Challenges\n\n### Mastery-Based Availability\n\nBoss encounters unlock based on competence rather than time because real professional challenges appear when you're ready to handle them, not on a schedule.\n\n**Design Intent:** Ensure players face challenges they can meaningfully engage with. Unlock thresholds represent the minimum competence needed to even attempt these professional scenarios.\n\n**Narrative Context:** In real practice, you don't face certain types of challenges until supervisors believe you're ready. Complex cases, leadership responsibilities, and high-stakes situations require demonstrated competence.\n\n### Five-Phase Escalation\n\nThe consistent five-phase structure reflects how real professional challenges build in complexity and pressure.\n\n**Design Intent:** Create a predictable framework that allows for different content while maintaining consistent emotional arc - initial confidence, growing challenge, crisis point, final push, resolution.\n\n**Narrative Context:** Professional challenges often follow this pattern - they start manageable, reveal hidden complexity, reach a crisis point where everything seems overwhelming, require a final application of all your skills, then resolve into new understanding.\n\n### Multiple Solution Paths\n\nDifferent build approaches succeed because real professional competence takes many forms.\n\n**Design Intent:** Validate different learning styles and professional strengths. Technical expertise, communication skills, and integrative thinking are all valuable professional approaches.\n\n**Narrative Context:** Medical physics is a diverse field where different professionals bring different strengths. Some excel at equipment troubleshooting, others at protocol development, others at patient communication. All paths can lead to professional success.\n\n## Mentor Relationships: Professional Guidance\n\n### Four Distinct Approaches\n\nThe four mentors represent different valid approaches to medical physics practice, each emphasizing different aspects of professional development.\n\n**Design Intent:** Show players that there are multiple ways to be excellent in this field. Relationship development is about finding mentors whose approaches resonate with your developing professional identity.\n\n**Narrative Context:** Real mentorship relationships form around shared values and complementary strengths. Students naturally gravitate toward mentors whose approaches make sense to them, while benefiting from exposure to different perspectives.\n\n### Relationship Progression Through Engagement\n\nMentor relationships develop through participation in activities and dialogue rather than mechanical optimization.\n\n**Design Intent:** Reward authentic engagement over gaming the system. Relationships should feel earned through shared professional experiences.\n\n**Narrative Context:** Real mentorship develops through working together on meaningful problems. Trust and respect grow from demonstrated competence and shared values, not from saying the right things.\n\n## Progressive Control: Professional Development\n\n### Increasing Agency with Competence\n\nPlayer control increases as mastery develops because real professional development involves gaining increasing autonomy and responsibility.\n\n**Design Intent:** Create a natural progression from guided learning to independent practice. Players earn increased freedom through demonstrated competence.\n\n**Narrative Context:** Medical physics education moves from highly supervised student work to increasingly independent resident responsibilities to fully autonomous professional practice. Agency follows competence.\n\n### Time Control as Professional Maturity\n\nThe ability to structure your own schedule is both a privilege and a responsibility of professional development.\n\n**Design Intent:** Make increased control feel like earned trust rather than arbitrary game mechanics. Players appreciate freedom more when they've experienced guided structure first.\n\n**Narrative Context:** Students follow rigid schedules because they need structure. Professionals manage their own time because they understand priorities and can be trusted with autonomy.\n\n## System Integration Philosophy\n\n### Everything Connects\n\nAll systems reference and reinforce each other because real professional development is holistic - knowledge, relationships, and practical skills all develop together.\n\n**Design Intent:** Avoid the feeling of disconnected mini-games. Every system should feel like part of a coherent professional development experience.\n\n**Narrative Context:** Professional growth isn't compartmentalized. Your knowledge development affects your relationship with mentors, which provides opportunities for new challenges, which develops your practical skills, which deepens your knowledge understanding.\n\n### Choice Supports Identity\n\nEvery major choice in the game (which stars to unlock, which mentors to engage with, which applications to use) should feel like it's building toward a coherent professional identity.\n\n**Design Intent:** Make players feel like they're not just optimizing numbers, but discovering who they want to be as a professional. Choices should feel personally meaningful.\n\n**Narrative Context:** Professional development is ultimately about identity formation - what kind of medical physicist do you want to be? How do you want to contribute to patient care? What aspects of the field excite you most?\n\n---\n\n## Related Documentation\n\n**Technical Specifications:**\n- `data/constants/game-constants.yaml` - Detailed numerical implementation\n- `data/stars/stars-definitions.yaml` - Complete constellation system\n- `data/mentors/mentors.yaml` - Mentor relationship mechanics\n- `data/bosses/boss-encounters.yaml` - Boss encounter specifications\n\n**Design Context:**\n- `content/master-gdd.md` - Overall game vision and philosophy\n- `content/mentors/mentor-philosophies.md` - Mentor character development\n- `content/constellation-design.md` - Knowledge visualization philosophy ",

selection based on learning goals rather than time optimization\n**Professional Development:** Building competence that naturally improves efficiency\n\n### Adaptive Difficulty Through Mastery\n\nThe system rewards learning through natural time efficiency gains:\n\n**Expertise Development:** Higher mastery reduces activity duration behind the scenes\n**Increased Capacity:** More accomplished players naturally fit more activities into their day\n**Progressive Agency:** Advanced players gain more control over their schedule\n\n## Technical Implementation Philosophy\n\n### Invisible Complexity\n\nThe sophisticated 100-unit time tracking system operates completely behind the scenes, allowing for precise control while presenting simple, intuitive interfaces to players.\n\n**Backend Precision:** Exact time calculations enable balanced gameplay\n**Frontend Simplicity:** Players see only relevant, contextual information\n**Seamless Integration:** Time system supports rather than dominates gameplay\n\n### Performance-Conscious Design\n\nVisual updates are carefully managed to provide rich environmental storytelling without overwhelming system resources:\n\n**Staged Updates:** Major visual changes occur during phase transitions\n**Optimized Rendering:** Distance-based and importance-based update priorities\n**Preloaded Assets:** Anticipatory loading prevents transition delays\n\n### Modular Enhancement\n\nThe system supports progressive implementation complexity:\n\n**MVP Foundation:** Basic time progression with minimal visual feedback\n**Enhanced Experience:** Rich environmental storytelling and character behaviors\n**Polish Features:** Advanced contextual messaging and special time effects\n\n## Educational Integration\n\n### Supporting Learning Flow\n\nThe time system design directly supports educational goals:\n\n**Momentum Preservation:** Time transitions don't interrupt learning flow\n**Natural Breaks:** Phase changes provide organic stopping points for reflection\n**Progress Visualization:** Day progression parallels learning development\n\n### Professional Skill Development\n\nTime management in the game mirrors real professional development:\n\n**Efficiency Through Competence:** Expertise naturally improves time utilization\n**Priority Setting:** Activity selection reflects professional

  "cards/etching-system-design.md": "# Etching System Design\n\nThe Etching system represents **discovered wisdom** - ancient and modern knowledge patterns that guide constellation formation. These hand-drawn star maps transform abstract learning connections into **tangible discovery moments**, making the process of knowledge integration feel like archaeological discovery and scholarly research.\n\n## Design Philosophy\n\n### Knowledge Archaeology\nEtchings embody the concept of **knowledge archaeology** - the idea that profound insights already exist, waiting to be discovered and understood. This transforms learning from creating new knowledge to **uncovering eternal patterns** that have guided medical physics practitioners across generations.\n\nStudents become **knowledge archaeologists**, discovering fragments of understanding in libraries, mentor relationships, and professional environments. This perspective makes learning feel like meaningful discovery rather than arbitrary information consumption.\n\n### Pattern Recognition as Mastery\nThe etching system teaches that **true mastery involves pattern recognition** - seeing the connections between seemingly disparate concepts. Each etching represents a **meta-pattern** that reveals how individual stars connect to form greater understanding.\n\nThis approach mirrors real professional development, where expertise comes not just from knowing facts but from recognizing the underlying patterns that guide decision-making and problem-solving.\n\n### Wisdom Transmission\nEtchings represent **wisdom transmission** across professional generations. Each etching has an authentic source - mentors sharing personal insights, historical documents preserving institutional knowledge, or environmental discoveries revealing practical wisdom.\n\n## Etching Categories & Discovery Philosophy\n\n### Domain Etchings: Foundation Patterns\n**Domain etchings** represent **foundational professional patterns** within each specialization. These are the first patterns students discover, typically through mentor relationships, establishing the basic framework for understanding each field.\n\nThese etchings are **simpler to complete** because they represent well-established professional knowledge. They provide students with confidence and early success in pattern formation while building domain identity.\n\n### Cross-Domain Etchings: Integration Mastery\n**Cross-domain etchings** represent **synthesis achievements** - the ability to see connections across traditional disciplinary boundaries. These etchings unlock **special application cards** that can only emerge from integrated understanding.\n\nThe **increased complexity** of these patterns reflects the real challenge of interdisciplinary thinking. Students must develop competence across multiple domains before these integration opportunities become visible.\n\n### Legendary Etchings: Transformative Insights\n**Legendary etchings** represent **transformative professional insights** - the kind of deep understanding that fundamentally changes how someone practices medical physics. These are rare, powerful patterns with **special narrative significance**.\n\nTheir **hidden locations** and **complex requirements** reflect how profound insights often emerge unexpectedly from sustained engagement with the field rather than systematic study.\n\n## Discovery Method Design\n\n### Library Discoveries: Academic Tradition\n**Library etchings** connect students to the **academic tradition** of medical physics. Found tucked in textbooks or historical documents, these represent the accumulated wisdom of the field's scholarly heritage.\n\nThe **yellowed paper and astronomical style** creates authentic connection to scientific tradition, making students feel part of a continuous intellectual lineage.\n\n### Mentor Gifts: Personal Wisdom\n**Mentor-gifted etchings** represent **personal wisdom transmission** - the unique insights each mentor has developed through professional experience. The visual design reflects each mentor's personality and approach to the field.\n\n- **Dr. Garcia's sketches** emphasize humanistic care principles\n- **Jesse's diagrams** show practical engineering wisdom  \n- **Dr. Kapoor's drafts** display measurement precision\n- **Dr. Quinn's abstractions** reveal theoretical insights\n\n### Environmental Discoveries: Institutional Knowledge\n**Environmental etchings** represent **institutional knowledge** - the practical wisdom embedded in professional environments. Found on whiteboards, in desk drawers, or hidden in equipment, these reflect how knowledge lives within professional spaces.\n\nThis category teaches students to be **observant learners** who recognize that wisdom can be found everywhere in professional environments, not just in formal educational materials.\n\n## Pattern Formation Mechanics\n\n### Star Requirement Validation\nThe **star requirement system** ensures that pattern formation represents **genuine understanding** rather than arbitrary connection. Students must have actually mastered the constituent knowledge before they can form the pattern.\n\nThis creates **meaningful progression gates** where pattern formation becomes a **celebration of achieved competence** rather than just mechanical connection.\n\n### Visual Pattern Matching\nThe **visual overlay system** helps students understand how abstract concepts connect by providing **concrete geometric patterns**. This bridges the gap between symbolic knowledge and spatial understanding.\n\nThe **connection animation** that matches etching patterns provides satisfying feedback that reinforces the learning accomplishment while creating memorable visual associations with the knowledge connections.\n\n### Card Unlock Integration\n**Pattern-forming etchings** that unlock special cards create **meaningful progression rewards**. Students see immediate tangible benefits from forming complex knowledge connections, reinforcing the value of integration over specialization.\n\n## Seasonal Discovery Progression\n\n### Spring: Foundation and Mentorship\n**Early etchings** (The Healer's Path, The Engineer's Blueprint) establish **foundational patterns** and **mentor relationships**. These provide early success and confidence while teaching the basic mechanics of pattern formation.\n\n### Summer: Academic Discovery\n**Library-based discoveries** (The Physician's Eye, Temporal Mastery) connect students to the **academic tradition** while providing more complex patterns to master. This season emphasizes research and scholarly development.\n\n### Fall: Advanced Integration\n**Complex integration etchings** (The Metrologist's Scale, The Old Ways) require **sustained engagement** and **advanced mastery**. These patterns reflect the deeper understanding that emerges from extended study.\n\n### Winter: Legendary Achievement\n**Legendary etchings** (The Calibration Singularity, The Resident's Journey) represent **transformative insights** that mark the transition from student to practitioner. These create memorable capstone experiences.\n\n## Visual Design Philosophy\n\n### Authentic Materiality\nEach etching has **authentic visual materiality** that reflects its source and age. Library etchings look like historical documents, mentor gifts reflect personal styles, environmental discoveries show practical wear.\n\nThis **material authenticity** helps students feel connected to real professional environments and traditions rather than abstract game mechanics.\n\n### Personality Reflection\n**Mentor-specific visual styles** ensure that each etching feels like it genuinely came from that person. Students learn to recognize not just what mentors know, but **how they think** and **how they approach problems**.\n\n### Discovery Narrative\nThe **visual storytelling** of each etching discovery creates memorable moments that students associate with their learning journey. Finding \"The Old Ways\" after extensive library research feels like uncovering hidden professional wisdom.\n\n## Integration with Learning Objectives\n\n### Pattern Recognition Skills\nThe etching system develops **pattern recognition skills** that are essential for professional medical physics practice. Students learn to see connections between concepts that aren't explicitly taught.\n\n### Professional Identity Formation\n**Etching collection** mirrors **professional identity development** - gradually building a personal understanding of how the field's knowledge connects and integrates.\n\n### Motivation Through Discovery\nThe **discovery-based progression** provides consistent motivation through the excitement of finding new patterns and unlocking new capabilities. Each etching discovery feels like a genuine achievement.\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\n### Tutorial Progression\n**Early mentor etchings** provide gentle introduction to pattern formation mechanics while establishing mentor relationships and domain understanding.\n\n### Academic Integration\n**Library etchings** require students to engage with research activities, naturally integrating pattern discovery with scholarly development.\n\n### Legendary Challenges\n**Complex legendary etchings** provide long-term goals that require sustained engagement and mastery development across multiple systems.\n\nThe etching system transforms abstract knowledge connections into tangible discoveries, making the process of learning integration feel like meaningful exploration of professional wisdom traditions.

  "character-arcs/marcus-chen.md": "# Marcus Chen Character Arc\n\n> **Also Known As**: \"The Difficult Coworker\", \"The Entropic Colleague\"  \n> **Boss Encounter ID**: `marcus-chen`  \n> **Primary System**: Emotional Energy (EE) System\n\nMarcus Chen represents one of the most complex boss encounters in Rogue Resident, tackling real workplace dynamics within the medical field. This encounter uses the **Emotional Energy (EE) system** instead of standard Momentum, reflecting the psychological pressure of workplace conflict (see `data/bosses/marcus-chen.yaml` for complete mechanics).\n\n## Character Overview\n\nMarcus is a second-year resident whose perfectionism and fear of inadequacy create genuine workplace dysfunction. Unlike typical video game antagonists, Chen isn't evil - he's a reflection of real pressures in medical training where competition can become toxic.\n\n**Key Character Data** (from `marcus-chen.yaml`):\n- **Year in Program**: 2nd year (player is 1st year)\n- **Core Fear**: Becoming another failure after witnessing residents wash out\n- **Personality**: Perfectionist, competitive, initially helpful but increasingly insecure\n- **Trigger**: Morrison case assignment goes to player instead of him\n\n## The Seven-Week Progression\n\nThe encounter mechanics support a slow-burn character development across weeks:\n\n### Weeks 1-3: The Helpful Senior\nChen genuinely tries to help the new resident. This isn't fake - he remembers being lost in his first year and wants to prevent others from struggling like he did.\n\n### Week 2: Subtle Undermining\nSmall comments begin. \"Are you sure that's the approach Amara would take?\" Still appears helpful on the surface, but introduces doubt.\n\n### Week 4: Open Competition\nThe mask comes off. Chen starts competing directly, correcting the player publicly, volunteering for everything first.\n\n### Week 6: Breaking Point\nThe Morrison case assignment triggers his crisis. The department assigning a complex case to the first-year instead of him represents everything he fears about his own inadequacy.\n\n### Week 7: Boss Encounter\n\n## The Morrison Case Competition\n\n**Setting**: Split-screen planning stations with department staff watching\n**Mechanism**: Racing to complete treatment plans while Chen progressively loses composure\n\n### The Emotional Energy System\n\nUnlike other bosses that use domain-specific energy, Chen uses **Emotional Energy (EE)** representing the player's composure under workplace pressure. This system has four thresholds (see `marcus-chen.yaml` for exact values):\n\n- **75+ EE**: Normal operation\n- **50-74 EE**: Questions become harder  \n- **25-49 EE**: Both parties become reactive and emotional\n- **<25 EE**: Crisis mode - near-impossible to succeed\n\n**EE drains from**:\n- Chen's interruptions (primary source)\n- Wrong answers under pressure\n- Time pressure\n- Chen outperforming the player\n\n**EE recovers from**:\n- Correct answers (builds confidence)\n- Empathy responses (rare dialogue opportunities)\n- Card abilities (preparation matters)\n- Combo streaks (getting into flow state)\n\n### Five-Phase Escalation\n\nThe encounter has five phases with escalating interruption patterns:\n\n1. **Professional Competitive** (3 min): Interrupts only on wrong answers\n2. **Increasing Pressure** (3 min): Adds pressure on slow responses  \n3. **Desperate Interruption** (4 min): Interrupts on his weak domains (RT/DOS)\n4. **Emotional Breakdown** (3 min): Random desperate interruptions\n5. **Clarity or Collapse** (2 min): Either finds peace or complete breakdown\n\n**Key Dialogue Progression**:\n- Phase 1: \"Actually, the optimization approach would be...\"\n- Phase 2: \"No no no, it has to be PERFECT, like Amara would do!\"\n- Phase 3: \"I can't be another failure. Not after watching David wash out...\"\n- Phase 4: \"Every night I dream about the mistakes... what if I hurt someone?\"\n- Phase 5: \"Maybe... maybe there's more than one way to be excellent\"\n\n## Resolution and Growth\n\n### Victory Conditions\nThe encounter has multiple resolution paths based on remaining EE:\n\n**High EE Victory (50+)**: Chen finds clarity, realizes his approach is unsustainable. Full reconciliation and mentor respect.\n\n**Low EE Victory (25+)**: Mutual exhaustion. Both parties recognize the toxicity but need time to heal.\n\n**Defeat**: Chen has a complete breakdown. Retry required, but subsequent attempts have modified parameters to represent learning from the experience.\n\n### Post-Encounter Relationship\n\n**Day of Encounter**: Brief reconciliation as both parties are exhausted\n**That Evening**: Chen gives player the storage closet key with the line: \"Sometimes forgotten spaces have the most to teach us\"\n**Summer Progression**: Chen becomes an occasional ally, having found his own interpretation of the constellation phenomenon\n\n## Narrative Integration with Game Systems\n\n### Connection to Amara's Legacy\nChen represents the danger of trying to force Amara's exact path rather than finding one's own way. His particles \"scatter instead of flow\" - a visual representation of blocked learning due to fear and pressure.\n\n### Storage Closet Unlock\nVictory unlocks the storage closet, beginning the **Summer Journal** discovery arc and eventually leading to **Pico**. This isn't arbitrary - Chen's growth moment opens access to forgotten spaces where real learning can happen.\n\n### Mentor Reactions\nDifferent mentors interpret the Chen encounter through their philosophical lenses:\n- **Quinn**: Validates the player's emotional intelligence\n- **Garcia**: Emphasizes patient care requiring emotional stability  \n- **Kapoor**: Concerned about workplace drama affecting performance\n- **Jesse**: Relates to mechanical systems - sometimes components interfere with each other\n\n## Design Philosophy: Show Don't Tell\n\nThe encounter avoids heavy-handed emotional intelligence mechanics. Instead:\n- Chen's arc unfolds naturally through environmental storytelling\n- Dialogue progression reveals his fears organically\n- Mechanical pressure creates narrative space for character development\n- Player succeeds through core gameplay skills, not separate emotional mechanics\n\nThe emotional journey happens alongside the medical physics challenge, not instead of it.\n\n## Real-World Resonance\n\nThis encounter addresses genuine issues in medical training:\n- Imposter syndrome in high-stakes environments\n- Competition vs. collaboration in patient care\n- How workplace toxicity affects learning and patient outcomes\n- The importance of emotional regulation in medical practice\n\nMarcus Chen isn't a caricature - he's a realistic portrayal of how good people can become problems under systemic pressure.\n\n## Implementation Priority\n\nThis is marked as **high priority** in the mechanics file because it establishes several crucial systems:\n- The emotional energy overlay system (template for other boss encounters)\n- Workplace relationship dynamics\n- The summer content unlock progression\n- Integration between mechanical challenge and character development\n\nThe encounter serves as proof-of-concept that Rogue Resident can tackle complex human dynamics while maintaining its educational core.

  "mentors/mentor-philosophies.md": "# Mentor Philosophical Alignments: The Five Perspectives\n\nEach mentor in Rogue Resident represents a different approach to understanding the constellation phenomenon and medical physics education. Their philosophical differences create narrative tension while allowing players to form their own interpretations (see `data/mentors/mentors.yaml` for complete character data and mechanical relationships).\n\n## The Three-Interpretation Framework\n\nThe game deliberately maintains ambiguity about the constellation's true nature through three equally valid interpretations (detailed in `data/constants/constellation-phenomenon.yaml`):\n\n1. **Pattern Recognition Extreme** (Psychological)\n2. **Fractal Reality** (Philosophical) \n3. **Perception Creates Reality** (Metaphysical)\n\nEach mentor subtly supports different interpretations without being dogmatic, creating space for player discovery.\n\n---\n\n## Dr. Quinn: The Scientific Advocate\n\n**Core Philosophy**: Pattern Recognition Extreme\n**Approach**: Encouraging but grounded in measurable science\n\n### Character Overview\nQuinn views the constellation as the ultimate cognitive enhancement tool. As Amara's former supervisor and the keeper of her spring journal, Quinn has the most direct experience with exceptional residents but maintains a scientific framework for understanding their abilities.\n\n### Key Beliefs\n- Exceptional minds create measurable neural pathway improvements\n- Pattern recognition can be enhanced through proper training\n- The constellation represents optimized cognitive processing\n- Everything can be explained through neuroscience and learning theory\n\n### Dialogue Philosophy\nQuinn never dismisses the mysterious aspects but always seeks scientific explanations:\n- \"Your mind is creating new neural pathways at an accelerated rate\"\n- \"Let's examine the measurable improvements in your learning curve\"\n- \"We can explain this through cognitive science\"\n\n### Relationship with Player\n- **Spring Journal Provider**: Entrusts player with Amara's early work\n- **Research Mentor**: Focuses on methodology and reproducible results\n- **Slight Disappointment**: If player leans too heavily into mystical interpretations\n- **Long-term Support**: Most consistent advocate for player's exceptional abilities\n\n---\n\n## Dr. Garcia: The Intuitive Healer\n\n**Core Philosophy**: Perception Creates Reality (subtle, never stated directly)\n**Approach**: Empathetic support with mysterious observations\n\n### Character Overview\nGarcia represents the humanistic side of medical physics, focusing on patient care and intuitive understanding. While never explicitly stating metaphysical beliefs, Garcia makes observations that hint at deeper connections between consciousness and healing.\n\n### Key Beliefs\n- True understanding affects patient outcomes in measurable ways\n- Some aspects of medicine can't be quantified, only experienced\n- Emotional stability is crucial for effective treatment\n- The constellation may represent harmony between practitioner and practice\n\n### Dialogue Philosophy\nGarcia's support is always subtle and observational:\n- \"When you truly understand, patients feel it\"\n- \"There's something special about residents who embrace the whole system\"\n- \"Some things can't be measured, only experienced\"\n\n### Relationship with Player\n- **Emotional Support**: Primary source of encouragement during difficult periods\n- **Patient Care Focus**: Emphasizes the human side of medical physics\n- **Amara Warnings**: Cautions against losing oneself in the pursuit of understanding\n- **Chen Encounter**: Validates emotional intelligence after boss fight\n\n---\n\n## Jesse: The Practical Bridge\n\n**Core Philosophy**: Pattern Recognition Extreme (practical application)\n**Approach**: Mechanical analogies and hands-on wisdom\n\n### Character Overview\nJesse serves as the bridge between high theory and practical application. With deep equipment knowledge and a grounded personality, Jesse provides the most accessible interpretation of the constellation phenomenon through mechanical analogies.\n\n### Key Beliefs\n- Understanding is like muscle memory for your brain\n- Once you see system connections, you can't unsee them\n- Complex phenomena have practical explanations\n- Theory must always serve practical outcomes\n\n### Dialogue Philosophy\nJesse relates everything to mechanical systems and practical experience:\n- \"It's like muscle memory but for your brain\"\n- \"Once you see how systems connect, you can't unsee it\"\n- \"Dr. Quinn's got the theory, Garcia's got the heart, I've got the nuts and bolts\"\n\n### Relationship with Player\n- **Equipment Mastery**: Teaches practical skills and troubleshooting\n- **Grounding Influence**: Prevents player from getting lost in abstract theory\n- **Pico Connection**: Later serves as bridge to understanding consciousness in machines\n- **Practical Wisdom**: Provides down-to-earth perspective on complex phenomena\n\n---\n\n## Dr. Kapoor: The Scientific Skeptic\n\n**Core Philosophy**: Dismissive of anything beyond measurement\n**Approach**: Professional concern and focus on standards\n\n### Character Overview\nKapoor provides crucial counterweight to mystical interpretations while representing legitimate concerns about maintaining professional standards. Having worked with Amara, Kapoor is genuinely worried about residents following her path toward obsession.\n\n### Key Beliefs\n- Focus on measurable outcomes and patient safety\n- The constellation is merely a visualization tool\n- Amara's fate serves as a cautionary tale\n- Professional standards must override personal fascination\n\n### Dialogue Philosophy\nKapoor's skepticism comes from concern, not dismissal:\n- \"The constellation is a useful visualization tool, nothing more\"\n- \"Amara lost herself in fantasies\"\n- \"I don't want to see another resident go down Amara's path\"\n\n### Relationship with Player\n- **Dosimetry Introduction**: Day 3 precision measurement focus\n- **Professional Standards**: Emphasizes accuracy and patient safety\n- **Legitimate Concerns**: Raises important questions about balance\n- **Post-Chen Reaction**: Concerned about workplace drama affecting performance\n\n---\n\n## Marcus Chen: The Desperate Seeker\n\n**Core Philosophy**: Desperate Believer (will accept any interpretation)\n**Approach**: Forcing understanding through competitive pressure\n\n### Character Overview\nChen represents the danger of seeking meaning through comparison and force rather than natural discovery. His desperate need to \"see what Amara saw\" demonstrates how the constellation can become an unhealthy obsession when approached incorrectly.\n\n### Key Beliefs (Pre-Boss)\n- There must be something greater than ordinary medical practice\n- Perfection is the only acceptable standard\n- Amara's path is the only valid path to excellence\n- Competition drives improvement\n\n### Dialogue Philosophy (Evolution)\nChen's dialogue evolves through his character arc:\n- **Early**: \"If I could just see what Amara saw...\"\n- **Crisis**: \"It has to be PERFECT, like Amara would do!\"\n- **Breakdown**: \"I can't be another failure like David\"\n- **Growth**: \"Maybe there's more than one way to be excellent\"\n\n### Relationship with Player\n- **Seven-Week Progression**: From helpful to competitive to crisis\n- **Boss Encounter**: Emotional Energy system represents workplace pressure\n- **Storage Key Provider**: Post-encounter growth enables player's summer progression\n- **Alternative Path**: Eventually finds his own interpretation of excellence\n\n---\n\n## Philosophical Interactions and Conflicts\n\n### The Science vs. Intuition Tension\n**Quinn vs. Garcia**: Scientific measurement versus intuitive understanding\n- Quinn focuses on reproducible cognitive improvements\n- Garcia emphasizes unmeasurable aspects of patient care\n- Player experiences both perspectives as equally valid\n\n### The Skeptical Counterpoint\n**Kapoor vs. Everyone**: Professional caution versus exploration\n- Provides important reality checks on mystical thinking\n- Raises legitimate concerns about patient safety\n- Creates dramatic tension without being antagonistic\n\n### The Practical Middle Ground\n**Jesse as Bridge**: Connects abstract theory to practical reality\n- Makes complex phenomena accessible through analogies\n- Prevents player from getting lost in philosophical debates\n- Demonstrates that understanding serves action\n\n### The Cautionary Tale\n**Chen's Arc**: Shows the danger of forced seeking\n- Represents competition culture in medical training\n- Demonstrates how pressure inhibits natural learning\n- Provides character growth through finding personal path\n\n---\n\n## Implementation in Gameplay\n\n### Lunch Choice Consequences (Day 3)\nEach mentor choice provides different narrative insights:\n- **Garcia**: Patient care perspective, warnings about obsession\n- **Jesse**: Technical excitement, hints about phenomena\n- **Quinn**: Research potential, subtle Amara references\n\n### Progressive Revelation\nAs player progresses, mentors notice and react to constellation effects:\n- **Early Game**: Only player sees effects\n- **Mid Game**: Mentors notice unusual phenomena\n- **Late Game**: Effects become undeniable\n\n### Chen's Interference\nChen's presence affects learning environment:\n- **Toxic Period**: Particle void disrupts normal flow\n- **Visual Effect**: Domain colors can temporarily lock\n- **Post-Boss**: Normal particle flow returns to his area\n\n---\n\n## Design Philosophy: Multiple Valid Perspectives\n\nThe mentor system demonstrates that:\n- **No Single Truth**: Each interpretation has merit\n- **Personal Resonance**: Players gravitate toward mentors whose philosophy matches their beliefs\n- **Respectful Disagreement**: Mentors disagree without being dismissive\n- **Growth Through Dialogue**: Different perspectives enhance rather than diminish understanding\n\nThe goal is not to prove one interpretation correct, but to show how different philosophical approaches can coexist and enrich the learning experience.\n\n---\n\n## Real-World Resonance\n\nThese philosophical differences reflect real debates in:\n- **Medical Education**: Theory vs. practice, measurement vs. intuition\n- **Consciousness Research**: Materialism vs. idealism vs. pragmatism\n- **Learning Theory**: Cognitive vs. humanistic vs. behaviorist approaches\n- **Workplace Dynamics**: How different personality types contribute to teams\n\nThe mentors represent authentic perspectives that players might encounter in real medical physics programs, grounding the fantastical elements in genuine human experience.
