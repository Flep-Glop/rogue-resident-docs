## 🔗 INTEGRATION STRATEGY (Anti-Patchwork)

### **Data Flow Architecture**

mentor_system -> boss_preparation: relationship_bonuses, guidance_content

boss_encounter_engine -> character_development: encounter_results, resolution_paths

energy_systems -> encounter_performance: energy_tracking, mentor_bonuses

boss_completion -> narrative_progression: unlocks, relationship_changes


### **Shared Dependencies** (Plan for these)

- Mentor relationship tracking system

- Energy/momentum management system

- Character dialogue and voice consistency

- Narrative progression and unlock system


### **💥 FAILURE MODES TO PREVENT**

- Boss encounters feeling disconnected from character development

- Preparation activities that don't meaningfully impact encounters

- Energy systems that feel mechanical rather than emotional

- Resolution paths that don't affect ongoing relationships


### **�� Testing Strategy**
