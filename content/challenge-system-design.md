## Educational Philosophy

### Assessment for Learning, Not Testing

Rogue Resident's challenge system serves learning goals rather than evaluation goals. Every question and challenge should:
- **Reinforce conceptual understanding** rather than test memorization
- **Provide immediate educational feedback** on incorrect responses
- **Build towards practical application** of medical physics knowledge
- **Support multiple learning approaches** and cognitive styles

### Authentic Professional Context

Challenges should reflect real medical physics practice:
- **Realistic scenarios** that medical physicists actually encounter
- **Professional decision-making** rather than academic problem-solving
- **Integration of knowledge** across traditional subject boundaries
- **Time pressure** and resource constraints that mirror professional practice
