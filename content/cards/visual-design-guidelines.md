# Visual Design Guidelines: Cards & Etchings

This document establishes the comprehensive visual design standards for Rogue Resident's Application Cards and Etching systems. These guidelines ensure **visual consistency**, **professional authenticity**, and **meaningful symbolic representation** across all card and etching assets.

## Overall Design Philosophy

### Professional Aesthetic Over Fantasy
**Reject fantasy game tropes** in favor of **authentic professional aesthetics**. Every visual element should feel like it could belong in a real medical physics resident's toolkit - sophisticated, precise, and purposeful rather than magical or fantastical.

### Knowledge Made Manifest
Visual design should represent **knowledge becoming tangible power**. Cards and etchings are visualizations of abstract understanding becoming concrete professional tools.

### Authentic Materiality
Every visual element should have **believable material properties** that reflect its source and purpose. Library etchings look like aged academic documents, mentor gifts reflect personal styles, cards feel like sophisticated professional tools.

## Application Card Visual Framework
