# Quality Assurance & Testing

This document outlines the comprehensive quality assurance and testing framework for Rogue Resident's educational content. The QA process ensures educational effectiveness, technical accuracy, and seamless integration with game systems while maintaining high standards for student learning outcomes.

## Testing Methodology Overview

Quality assurance for Rogue Resident operates on multiple levels, from individual question validation to comprehensive system integration testing. The methodology emphasizes **iterative improvement** through data-driven feedback and **student-centered evaluation** to ensure educational effectiveness.

### Core Testing Principles
- **Educational Effectiveness**: Content must demonstrably improve student understanding
- **Technical Accuracy**: All subject matter must be factually correct and current
- **System Integration**: Content must work seamlessly with game mechanics
- **Student Experience**: Learning must be engaging, appropriately challenging, and rewarding
- **Scalability**: Testing methods must work across the full content volume (1,480+ questions)

## Content Testing Metrics

### Question-Level Metrics

**Success Rate Analysis**
- Track success rates by question type (Multiple Choice, Matching, Procedural, Calculation)
- Monitor difficulty level appropriateness (Beginner: 70-90%, Intermediate: 50-80%, Advanced: 30-70%)
- Identify questions with abnormal success patterns (too easy: >95%, too hard: <20%)
- Analyze success rate variation across different student populations

**Time Requirement Assessment**
- Measure actual time required vs. expected duration for each question type
- Target ranges: MC (30-60s), Matching (60-120s), Procedural (90-180s), Calculation (120-300s)
- Identify questions that consistently exceed time expectations
- Balance cognitive load with available time constraints

**Feedback Effectiveness Evaluation**

- Monitor connection between activities and constellation star understanding
- Assess transfer of learning to boss encounters and practical applications

### Boss Encounter Metrics

**Success/Failure Rate Analysis**

- Target: 60-80% success rate with adequate preparation
- Monitor retry rates and improvement patterns
- Identify encounters that consistently frustrate or overwhelm students

**Phase-Based Performance Tracking**
- Analyze success rates for each phase of boss encounters
- Identify phases that create disproportionate difficulty spikes
- Monitor recovery patterns after phase failures
- Track strategy adaptation across multiple attempts

**Resource Usage Monitoring**
- Track Insight, SP, and other resource expenditure during encounters
- Monitor effectiveness of different preparation strategies
- Identify resource management patterns that correlate with success
- Evaluate balance between resource investment and reward

**Preparation Activity Effectiveness**
- Measure correlation between specific preparation activities and encounter success
- Track which preparations provide the most significant advantages
- Monitor preparation time vs. encounter improvement ratio
- Identify underutilized or ineffective preparation options

## Content Balance Issue Identification

### Question Balance Issues

**Difficulty Inconsistency Detection**
- Questions classified as "Beginner" with <50% success rates
- Questions classified as "Advanced" with >85% success rates
- High variance in completion times within the same difficulty level
- Student complaints about difficulty labeling accuracy

**Wording and Clarity Problems**
- Questions with multiple valid interpretations (detected through student questions)
- High rates of "clarification requested" during testing
- Inconsistent performance between similar students on specific questions
- Feedback requests for question rewording

**Challenge Quantity Imbalances**
- Activities consistently completing significantly early or late
- Student fatigue indicators (performance drops within activities)
- Mentor feedback about activity scope appropriateness
- Comparison with target challenge counts (see `activity-framework.yaml`)

**Domain Representation Gaps**
- Uneven coverage across the four domains (RT, TP, LA, DOS)
- Missing connections between related concepts
- Insufficient progression from basic to advanced concepts
- Gaps in seasonal learning theme coverage

### Activity Balance Issues

**Time Allocation Problems**
- Consistent overruns or early completions (>±30% of estimated time)
- Rush through final challenges due to time pressure
- Insufficient time for feedback and reflection
- Mismatch between challenge complexity and allocated time

**Reward Distribution Imbalances**
- Student perception that effort exceeds reward value
- Rewards that don't align with educational objectives
- Inconsistent reward scales across similar activities
- Missing rewards for particularly challenging or valuable activities

### Boss Balance Issues

**Difficulty Spike Detection**
- Sharp increases in failure rates between phases
- Preparation requirements that eliminate viable build strategies
- Student feedback about "unfair" or "impossible" challenges
- Excessive dependency on specific stars or patterns

**Build Invalidation Monitoring**
- Certain character builds consistently failing encounters
- Preparation strategies that provide no meaningful advantage
- Over-reliance on specific mentor relationships or card combinations
