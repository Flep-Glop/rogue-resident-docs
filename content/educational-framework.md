# Educational Content Framework

The educational content framework defines how Rogue Resident delivers educational experiences that build deep understanding rather than surface-level memorization. This system emphasizes **knowledge connections** and **practical application** through carefully designed question types and adaptive difficulty.

## Educational Philosophy

Our approach centers on **conceptual understanding** - helping students build mental models that connect disparate concepts rather than isolated facts. Each educational interaction aims to strengthen the Knowledge Constellation by creating meaningful connections between stars.

The framework supports **domain mastery progression** by adapting challenge difficulty to player mastery levels, ensuring appropriate challenge without overwhelming students. This creates a learning experience that grows with the student's understanding.

## Question Type Design

### Multiple Choice Questions
The foundation of our educational system, these questions focus on **conceptual clarity** and **misconception identification**. Each question includes comprehensive feedback that addresses common misconceptions and reinforces correct understanding.

**Example from Dr. Quinn**:
> "What defines a small field in radiation therapy dosimetry?"
> 
> The correct answer focuses on lateral charged particle equilibrium being compromised - the **physics principle** rather than arbitrary size cutoffs.

### Matching Questions  
These questions emphasize **relationship understanding** between concepts, components, and their characteristics. They're particularly effective for building the connected knowledge that forms strong constellation patterns.

### Procedural Questions
Sequential process understanding is critical in medical physics. These questions test **workflow mastery** and help students understand why procedures follow specific sequences.

### Calculation Questions
Mathematical problem-solving with **conceptual significance**. Each calculation connects to broader physics principles, ensuring students understand both the math and its meaning.

### Boast Questions (Advanced Challenges)
High-risk, high-reward challenges that replace standard questions when players demonstrate confidence. These feature **nuanced scenarios** presented in the voice of mentors, encouraging intellectual risk-taking.

## Adaptive Difficulty System

The framework adapts to student mastery through **progressive challenge scaling** (see `educational-framework.yaml` for specific distributions). This ensures students are appropriately challenged without being overwhelmed.

- **Low mastery** (0-25%): Focus on foundational concepts with clear feedback
- **Moderate mastery** (25-50%): Balanced application and synthesis challenges  
- **High mastery** (50-75%): Complex scenarios requiring deeper understanding
- **Expert mastery** (75-100%): Advanced integration across multiple domains

## Content Volume Strategy

The framework defines **minimum content requirements** for comprehensive coverage (see `educational-framework.yaml` for specific numbers):

- **1,480 total questions** across all star types
- **Balanced distribution** across question types and difficulty levels
- **Domain-specific requirements** that match star importance and complexity

This ensures sufficient content variety while maintaining educational quality and avoiding repetition.

## Daily Learning Structure

The **content hierarchy** creates manageable learning sessions:

**Question** → **Challenge** → **Activity** → **Day**

This progression allows for:
- **Focused learning** in short bursts (questions)
- **Concept integration** in challenges  
- **Applied practice** in activities
- **Comprehensive development** across days

The 10-12 minute daily commitment ensures learning remains sustainable while providing meaningful educational progress.

## Integration with Game Systems

The educational framework connects with other game systems to create cohesive learning experiences:

- **Star System**: Questions directly contribute to star mastery progression
- **Mentor System**: Question presentation reflects mentor personalities and expertise
- **Application Cards**: Educational success influences card effectiveness
- **Boss Encounters**: Accumulated mastery determines encounter difficulty and options

This integration ensures educational content serves both learning objectives and engaging gameplay.
