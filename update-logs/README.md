# Update Logs

This folder contains chronological documentation of significant updates to the Rogue Resident documentation system.

## Purpose

Update logs serve as a historical record of:
- **Documentation Evolution**: Major changes to single source of truth documents
- **System Integration**: Implementation of new features and how they affect documentation
- **Version Tracking**: Clear timestamps and version progression
- **Decision Documentation**: Rationale behind significant documentation changes

## Naming Convention

Update log files follow the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.md`

Example: `2025-01-10-activity-interface-implementation.md`

## Usage Guidelines

**When to Create an Update Log:**
- Major documentation updates affecting multiple files
- Implementation of new systems requiring documentation updates
- Architectural changes that affect the single source of truth
- Quarterly documentation reviews and reconciliation

**When NOT to Create an Update Log:**
- Minor typo fixes or formatting adjustments

## Archive Policy

Update logs are permanent records and should not be deleted. For organization, logs older than 2 years may be moved to an `archive/` subfolder while maintaining the same naming convention.
