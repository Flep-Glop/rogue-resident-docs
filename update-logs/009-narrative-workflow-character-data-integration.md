# Update Log 009: Narrative Workflow Character Data Integration

**Date**: January 17, 2025  
**Update Type**: System Enhancement & Bug Fix  
**Affected Systems**: Narrative Workflow Generation, Template System, Data Extraction  
**Team Members**: AI Assistant, User (Luke Lussier)

## Summary

Comprehensive fix for missing character data in narrative workflow generation. Previously, generated narrative documents (character/world/plot contexts) contained empty character sections despite rich character data existing in the single source of truth. This update implements robust data extraction and template integration to ensure all character information is properly included.

## Detailed Changes

### Core Export Script Enhancement (`scripts/export.py`)

**Enhanced Mentor Data Extraction**:
- **Fixed YAML Structure Parsing**: Corrected mentor data extraction to use proper structure (`mentors.dr_garcia` vs incorrect nested structure)
- **Robust Data Mapping**: Implemented comprehensive mentor personality extraction including teaching styles, dialogue themes, and domain expertise
- **Character Arc Integration**: Enhanced character arc extraction from content files with preview and full content preservation
- **Focus Area Filtering Fix**: Ensured content data (containing character arcs) is always preserved regardless of focus area filtering

**Key Code Changes**:
```python
# Fixed mentor extraction - was looking for nested 'mentors.mentors.mentors' 
# Now correctly accesses 'mentors.dr_garcia' structure
for mentor_id, mentor_info in mentor_data['mentors'].items():
    mentors_structured[mentor_id] = {
        'name': mentor_info.get('full_name', mentor_info.get('title', mentor_id)),
        'teaching_style': mentor_info.get('character_traits', {}).get('teaching_style'),
        'personality': {...},
        'dialogue_themes': mentor_info.get('dialogue_themes', [])
    }

# Enhanced content preservation
if category == 'content':
    # Always preserve all content data since it contains character arcs
    filtered_data[category] = data
```

### Template System Updates

**Enhanced Data Structure Support**:
- **Narrative Context Template** (`templates/narrative-context.md.jinja`): Updated to use `mentors_data.structured_mentors` format
- **Story Continuity Template** (`templates/story-continuity.md.jinja`): Enhanced character database section with proper mentor data mapping
- **Lore Implementation Template** (`templates/lore-implementation.md.jinja`): Updated mentor personality engine section

**Template Improvements**:
- Added character arc display section with rich content previews
- Enhanced mentor personality sections with dialogue themes and teaching styles  
- Improved boss character integration
- Added proper data validation and fallback handling

### Web Application Fix (`rogue-docs-web/src/app/page.tsx`)

**Download Naming Fix**:
- Fixed download filename generation to use appropriate identifier based on workflow mode
- **Technical Mode**: Uses `selectedSystem` (e.g., "activity-interface-conversational.md")
- **Narrative Mode**: Uses `selectedNarrativeFocus` (e.g., "world-conversational.md", "character-implementation.md")

### Comprehensive Character Data Now Available

**Main Characters** (3):
- ✅ **Amara Sato**: Former resident with background mystery, Ionix connection
- ✅ **Pico**: Sentient companion with emotional development arc
- ✅ **Marcus Chen**: Complex boss encounter with workplace dynamics

**Mentor Personalities** (4):
- ✅ **Dr. Maria Garcia**: Staff Radiation Therapist, supportive/empathetic
- ✅ **Dr. Alexandra Quinn**: Senior Medical Physicist, innovative Ionix creator  
- ✅ **Jesse Martinez**: Senior Technician, practical/hands-on
- ✅ **Dr. Raj Kapoor**: Chief Medical Physicist, systematic/rigorous

**Rich Data Per Character**:
- ✅ Teaching styles and approaches
- ✅ Dialogue voices and communication patterns
- ✅ Domain expertise and professional roles
- ✅ Key dialogue themes and personality traits
- ✅ Character development arcs and story roles

### System Robustness Improvements

**Scalability Enhancements**:
- ✅ **Focus Area Flexibility**: Works for character, world, plot, and comprehensive workflows
- ✅ **Data Preservation**: Core narrative elements always included regardless of filtering
- ✅ **Template Resilience**: Proper fallback handling for missing or incomplete data
- ✅ **Cross-System Integration**: Character data consistent across all narrative workflows

**Quality Assurance**:
- ✅ All three narrative focus areas tested and working (character/world/plot)
- ✅ Reference file export system working (9 files exported per generation)
- ✅ Template rendering without errors across all document types
- ✅ Web app download naming fixed for both technical and narrative modes

## Technical Notes

### Data Flow Architecture
```
Single Source of Truth → Enhanced Data Extraction → Structured Character Data → Template Rendering → Rich Narrative Documents
```

### Key Integration Points
- **Mentor System**: `data/mentors/mentors.yaml` → Structured extraction → Template integration
- **Character Arcs**: `content/character-arcs/*.md` → Content preservation → Character display
- **Cross-References**: Proper linking between narrative elements and technical systems
- **Focus Areas**: Flexible filtering while preserving essential narrative elements

### Validation & Testing
- **Character Workflow**: ✅ All 4 mentors + 3 character arcs properly displayed
- **World Workflow**: ✅ Character data included with world-building focus
- **Plot Workflow**: ✅ Character data maintained with story progression focus
- **Web App Downloads**: ✅ Proper filenames for both technical and narrative modes

## Follow-Up Work

### Immediate Benefits
- **Writers/Narrative Designers**: Now have complete character context for story development
- **Developers**: Rich implementation guides with proper character personality frameworks  
- **AI Assistants**: Comprehensive story continuity references for consistent character voices
- **Web App Users**: Properly named downloads that match content focus

### Future Enhancements
